disabled_rules:

  - closure_parameter_position
  # Closure parameters should be on the same line as opening brace.

  - cyclomatic_complexity
  # Complexity of function bodies should be limited.
  # Default configuration: warning: 10, error: 20, ignores_case_statements: false

  - file_length
  # Files should not span too many lines.

  - function_body_length
  # Functions bodies should not span too many lines.

  - function_parameter_count
  # Number of function parameters should be low.

  - identifier_name
  # Identifier names should only contain alphanumeric characters and start with a lowercase character or should only contain capital letters.
  # In an exception to the above, variable names may start with a capital letter when they are declared static and immutable.
  # Variable names should not be too long or too short.

  - nesting
  # Types should be nested at most 1 level deep, and statements should be nested at most 5 levels deep.

  - todo
  # TODOs and FIXMEs should be resolved.

  - type_body_length
  # Type bodies should not span too many lines.

  - opening_brace
  # Disabled because it's handled by swiftformat
  # Opening braces should be preceded by a single space and on the same line as the declaration.

  - trailing_comma
  # Disabled because it's handled by swiftformat
  # Trailing commas in arrays and dictionaries should be avoided/enforced.

opt_in_rules:

  - closure_spacing
  # Closure expressions should have a single space inside each brace.

  - collection_alignment
  # All elements in a collection literal should be vertically aligned

  - contains_over_filter_count
  # Prefer `contains` over comparing `filter(where:).count` to 0.

  - contains_over_filter_is_empty
  # Prefer `contains` over using `filter(where:).isEmpty`.

  - contains_over_first_not_nil
  # Prefer `contains` over `first(where:) != nil` and `firstIndex(where:) != nil`.

  - contains_over_range_nil_comparison
  # Prefer `contains` over `range(of:) != nil` and `range(of:) == nil`.

  - convenience_type
  # Types used for hosting only static members should be implemented as a caseless enum to avoid instantiation.

  - empty_collection_literal
  # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing collection to an empty array or dictionary literal.

  - explicit_init
  # Explicitly calling .init() should be avoided.

  - literal_expression_end_indentation
  # Array and dictionary literal end should have the same indentation as the line that started it.

  - modifier_order
  # Modifier order should be consistent: [override, acl, setterACL, dynamic, mutators, lazy, final, required, convenience, typeMethods, owned]

  - multiline_arguments
  # Arguments should be either on the same line, or one per line.

  - multiline_parameters
  # Functions and methods parameters should be either on the same line, or one per line.

  - multiline_parameters_brackets
  # Multiline parameters should have their surrounding brackets in a new line.

  - overridden_super_call
  # Some overridden methods should always call super.

  - prefer_self_type_over_type_of_self
  # Prefer Self over type(of: self) when accessing properties or calling methods.

  - prohibited_super_call
  # Some methods should not call super

  - redundant_type_annotation
  # Variables should not have redundant type annotation.

  - sorted_first_last
  # Prefer using min() or max() over sorted().first or sorted().last

  - toggle_bool
  # Prefer someBool.toggle() over someBool = !someBool.

  - trailing_closure
  # Trailing closure syntax should be used whenever possible.

  - unneeded_parentheses_in_closure_argument
  # Parentheses are not needed when declaring closure arguments.

  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call
  # Function parameters should be aligned vertically if they’re in multiple lines in a method call.

  - vertical_whitespace_closing_braces
  # Don’t include vertical whitespace (empty line) before closing braces.
